# devOS
This is my own tutorial on OS for my self learning.

I love linux so much that I learn new thing daily while using it and for this reason I've started working on building my own OS from scratch.
In college I was taught
how to implement advanced features (pagination, semaphores, memory management, etc)
but:

- I never got to start from my own boot sector
- College is hard so I don't remember most of it.
- I'm fed up with people who think that reading an already existing kernel, even if small, is 
a good idea to learn operating systems.
